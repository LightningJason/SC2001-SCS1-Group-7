## Introduction
For small arrays, the recursive overhead of merge sort can become a significant portion of the overall execution time, making it less efficient compared to non-recursive algorithms like insertion sort. Hence, this project implements a hybrid sort that integrates Merge Sort with Insertion sort. 



## Algorithm Implementation

## Input Data
The algorithm was tested using inputs of arrays of sizes from (1000 to 510000).
For each of the sizes, a random dataset of integers were generated in the range of 1 to 100.

## Time Complexity




## Comparing with Original Merge Sort
After obtaining the optimal value of S, we compare the performance of the hybrid sort against merge sort in terms of key comparisons and CPU times on the dataset with 10 million integers.
